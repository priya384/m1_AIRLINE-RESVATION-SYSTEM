 ## Introduction
    A little carrier has fair obtained a computer for its modern mechanized reservation framework. 
    The proprietor has inquired to program the unused framework in C. 
    It is required  to type in a program to relegate seats on each flight of the aircrafts as it were put (capacity: 15 seats).
    The program ought to never allot a situate which is as of now  alloted.
    On the off chance that there’s no situate accessible, at that point print the message " the flight is full ". 
    After the flight is full and somebody need to cancel the booking, it is showing enter you’
    re the visa number you need to cancel it so after the traveler cancel it, 
    the framework straightforwardly free that put id somebody need to book that seat. 
    Besides, the framework ought to bring a boarding pass demonstrating the persons' 
    title, visa number and situate number as each situate is alloted, 
    set the comparing components of cluster to 1 to demonstrate that situate is now not accessible.
  
  ## Cost Features and Timeline
   
   ## Features
   
   - Highly customizable system
   - Reservation cancellation system
   - Trustworthy and reliable
   - Seamless, fast, and error-free online reservation facility to the users
   
   
   
  # Defining Our System
      The Carrier reservation framework is planned for clients to save a situate, cancel, show situate and exit the framework. 
      A equation is included within the work to calculate the seats are saved.
      Pseudocode is composed for some imperative codes.
      Some stream charts are moreover made for clarifying the method of the Airline reservation system. 
      From this task, I have learnt to execute a number of C concepts within the future ventures such as capacities, 
      switch explanation and do…while explanation, clusters, pointers and structures within the program.
   
  # SWOT Analysis
   ## Strengths
   
   - Easy to reserv tickets
   - Access to a customer database
   - Clear positioning
   - Clearly defined and successful implementations 
  
   ## Weaknesses 
    
   - Strong existing competitors
   - Many negative attitudes
   - No distinct product features
  
   ## Opportunities 
    
   - Add increased product augmentation
   - Develop and implement a loyalty program
   - Develop and implement a CRM program
   - Work to generate cost efficiencies

   ## Threats
    
   - Poor service culture
   - Dificult to handle bugs

   ## Why
    
   - Flight Reservation Framework shoots up the deals of an carrier company and gives a competitive edge. 
   - The essential reason for choosing flight reservation framework is to extend the number of bookings of the flight ticket.
 
   ## What
 
   - An "aircraft reservation" could be a legitimate contract whereby an carrier embraces, 
    in exchange for a certain sum of cash, to supply a situate to a particular traveler by plane on a 
    particular flight from one indicated air terminal to another.
  
   ## When
  
   - In the late 1950s, American Airlines wanted a system that would allow real-time access to flight details in all of its offices,
    and the integration and automation of its   booking and ticketing processes.
    It introduced an electronic reservations system, Magnetronic Reservisor, in 1952.
   
   ## Where
   
   - It can be used in any devices(laptop & PC) which has a preloaded application and it  will be usefull for all type of users.
   
   ## How
   
   - Aircraft reservation frameworks join aircraft plans, admission taxes, traveler  reservations and ticket records.
   - An airline's coordinate dispersion works inside their possess reservation framework, as well as pushing out data to the GDS.
   
  # Benefits of Flight Reservation System
    
   - Fully customized
   - User-friendly interface
   - Real-time update  
   - Easy cancellation process
   
  # Detailed Requirements
   
   - User Interfaces
   - Hardware Interfaces
   - Software Interfaces
   
  # High level Requirements
    
   - Customer should be able to add there Name manually.
   - Customer should be able to cancle the booked ticket.
   - Customer should be able to access Number of bookings by using display feature
   - Customer should be able to request reservation cancellation.

   
  # Low level Requirements
   
   ## Performance Requirements
  - System should be able to perform well in all platforms
      
   ## Maintainability Requirements 
   - User should be displayed acceptance message within 5 seconds, when he/she submits
   - entered data to the system.
   - Warning messages about entrance data out of defined standards must remain on the
    screen for 3 seconds.
    
   ## Safety Requirements
   - System should include store data in multifile system
   - System should assure data integrity

  # For better understanding of the project
  
   ## Behavioural Diagram
   - It consists of Flow chart.
   - It shows the flow of the project and by using this diagram any one can understand the logic behind the application.
   - By seeing this anyone can understand the logic and help them to improve the logic or to make it to simple one.
   ## Structural Diagram
   - It contains a UML diagram of the project.
   - BY seeing this anyone can understand the test cases behind project.
   - This is means of explaining the project in simple manner.
   
  # Implementation contains
  ## src
  - README.md
  - header.h
  - main.c
  - main.exe
  - multi records
  ## test
  - README.md
  
  These are headder, main, test and README  files
  To work with Reservation project or to run go through the main.c file this consists of the required code for the actions.
  To improve the application or to modify anything thing in this application go through all the files,
  that will give you the logic and the methods fallowed for the project.
  Go through the files and access the application and the logic of the application and this will give better exprerience.
  
  ## Test Plan
